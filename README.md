# example-docs

A repository containing a few examples of my non-confidential technical writing categorised as **graphic-design** and **long-form**.

## Graphic design

Image files illustrating architectures, process flows, and product concepts (filename prefix: **mm-graphic-design**.) 

> **Note:** 
These images are designed to be impactful and engaging rather than practical. See long-form documents for examples of practical graphic design.

## Long-form

Long-form documents covering **Cloud Computing**, **APIs**, and **graphic design** (filename prefix: **mm-long-form**.)
